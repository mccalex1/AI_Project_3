To use classifier do the following stuff.

I have a directory called Training where it gets the training set from.
  - Inside Training I have the directories labeled dollar, hash. hats, hearts, and smileys

To Run:
   - python image_classifier.py PATH_TO_FILE
   - on my computer it looked like python image_classifier TEST/02.jpg

If you want to see classifier data uncomment lines 48-55
